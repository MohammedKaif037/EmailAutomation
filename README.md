# Python Email Sender

This Python script allows you to send emails using the `smtplib` library. It prompts the user to input sender's email, password, recipient's email, subject, and message, then sends the email using SMTP via Gmail's server.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- Access to a Gmail account to send emails from.

## Installation

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/python-email-sender.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory.

    ```bash
    cd python-email-sender
    ```

## Usage

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Run the script using Python.

    ```bash
    python email_sender.py
    ```

3. Follow the prompts to input sender's email, password, recipient's email, subject, and message.

4. Press Enter and wait for the script to send the email.

## Important Notes

- Ensure that you have allowed less secure apps to access your Gmail account if you're using Gmail for this purpose.
- Your email password is hidden while typing due to security reasons.
- Make sure to review the script and understand its functionality before using it.
